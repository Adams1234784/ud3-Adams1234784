Battle Arena is an interactive turn‑based combat game built with JavaFX where players face progressively stronger monsters using normal attacks, special attacks, and healing abilities, each with unique strategic implications, inspired by classic RPGs such as Final Fantasy, Pokémon, and Dragon Quest, and designed to demonstrate core object‑oriented programming principles including inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction, and custom exception handling through a BattleException system that manages invalid game states; the game provides real‑time visual feedback with health bars and a comprehensive battle log, while UML diagrams and GUI wireframes illustrate the planning and structure behind the implementation, with streamlined features focusing on essential mechanics to ensure a playable and functional experience; the architecture includes an abstract Character class extended by Player and Monster, a BattleSystem that orchestrates rounds and logs outcomes, and a BattleController that wires JavaFX UI components to gameplay logic, showcasing composition and event handling; features include strategic turn‑based combat, multiple player actions, progressive difficulty, visual health tracking, exception handling, and a clean modern GUI; to run the project, ensure Java 17+ and Maven are installed, navigate to the project directory, and execute mvn clean javafx:run or ./mvnw clean javafx:run; the project structure follows Maven conventions with Java classes in src/main/java/cs112/ud3 (HelloApplication, BattleController, BattleSystem, Character, Player, Monster, BattleException) and FXML in src/main/resources/cs112/ud3/battle-view.fxml; technologies used include Java 23 (compatible with Java 17+), JavaFX 22, Maven, and FXML, and the project was authored by Adam Szloboda as the UD3 Final Project for CS112.
