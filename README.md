✨⚔️ Battle Arena: Turn‑Based Combat Showdown ⚔️✨ — Ready to test your strategy? Step into the arena where you’ll face waves of monsters that grow stronger every round, channeling the spirit of Final Fantasy, Pokémon, and Dragon Quest all in one JavaFX adventure 🎮. You’ll choose between a steady Attack 🗡️, a high‑risk Special 💥, or a clutch Heal ❤️ when things get dicey, watching slick health bars tick down and a live battle log narrate every move 📜. Behind the curtain, OOP magic powers the fight: an abstract Character class sets the rules, Player and Monster bring unique twists, and a BattleSystem keeps the rounds flowing while a custom BattleException makes sure no one breaks the rules 🧩. To play, clone the repo, make sure you’ve got Java 17+ and Maven, then run mvn clean javafx:run (or ./mvnw clean javafx:run) and let the battles begin 🚀. Win by outsmarting every monster 👾, lose by running out of HP 💀 — either way, the log will tell your story. Built with ❤️ by Adam Szloboda for CS112 UD3, this project is both a game and a showcase of inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and exception handling. So grab your sword, press Start, and enter the arena… 🗡️👾🔥✨
